Created a reponsive layout using flex. The content is about restaurant, with a nice carrousel related to the content of my page, the behavior when resizing is similar, it has 3 different layouts.

When the end user's screen is smaller than 480 pixels: the smartphone layout
If the screen is larger than 480 pixels but smaller than 1024 pixels: the tablet layout
If the screen is larger than 1024: regular desktop layout.

Style of the webpage depended upon the use semantic tags when necessary, using Flex Box, 
a nice carrousel, movement of the logo, content that were hidden when the layout is for mobile
use of fonts that needed to be download, implement an animation for the logo, the navbar links.
